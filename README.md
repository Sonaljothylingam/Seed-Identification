# Seed-Identification

Seed identification is a fundamental task in various fields such as agriculture, ecology, and conservation. While traditional methods relying on human judgment and visual examination have demonstrated high accuracy, they often face limitations in scalability and efficiency. In contrast, machine learning techniques offer a data-driven approach that can automate identification tasks, exhibiting promising outcomes in terms of consistency, efficiency, and scalability. This research addresses the challenge of seed identification by integrating clustering-based feature extraction with classification methodologies.

The study begins by applying the K-Medoids algorithm to cluster similar seed photos based on extracted traits. This clustering step serves as a crucial foundation for subsequent classification tasks, allowing for more effective and accurate identification. Various classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Decision Tree, are then employed to classify the clustered seed images.

The results reveal significant improvements in classification accuracy when clustering precedes classification. Specifically, SVM emerges as the top-performing algorithm, achieving an accuracy rate of 89.86%. This underscores the effectiveness of integrating clustering into the classification pipeline. Furthermore, an analysis of classification accuracy without clustering highlights the importance of this combined approach, with Random Forest yielding the highest accuracy at 32.68%.

In addition to traditional classification methods, ensemble learning techniques are explored to further enhance accuracy. GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, Bagging, ExtraTrees, and CatBoost are among the ensemble methods evaluated. Stacking and Bagging emerge as particularly promising techniques, achieving accuracy rates of 91.83% and 91.27%, respectively.

Overall, this integrated methodology offers a comprehensive solution for efficient and accurate seed identification. By bridging the gap between traditional methods and modern machine learning techniques, it provides researchers and practitioners with a valuable tool for seed-related studies across various domains.

Conclusions:
Seed identification plays a pivotal role in various disciplines, such as agriculture, ecology, and conservation. Traditional methods, reliant on human judgment and visual examination, exhibit high accuracy but face limitations in scalability and efficiency. In contrast, machine learning employs data-driven approaches to automate identification tasks, showcasing promising outcomes in terms of consistency, efficiency, and scalability. We use 2 methods to classify the seed images, one being via classification after clustering and another being via ensemble learning. In the method where we use classification, it can be noted that SVM achieves an accuracy of 89.86%, the greatest of all the algorithms. However, Random Forest achieves the maximum accuracy of 32.68% when identifying photos without any prior clustering. In the second method where we employed different methods of ensemble learning, it can be noted that stacking and bagging emerge as particularly promising techniques, achieving accuracy rates of 91.83% and 91.27%, respectively.
